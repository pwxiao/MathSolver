# a math solver 


## fucntions

- solve equation

input
```
f(x*x-1,0)
```
The f function includs two parameters,the first is the equation ,for example `x^2-1` means the equation `x^2 -1 = 0`,the second parameter is the approximate value which is uesd to reduce the calculation,

output
```
1
```

- common math-physics variable

things like `pi` `e`


- common math function

thinggs like`sin` `cos` `sqrt` ,

you can directy use them in the expression

- plot the graph

give the function it can draw the graph precisely

example:
```
y = sin(x)+1
```
